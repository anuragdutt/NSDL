<h1> Did the restriction on foreign
investment in local debt achieve the intended
outcome?</h1>

<p> A good policymaking process requires significant regulatory
capacity. Before the policy is enacted, the State must (a) identify a
<a
 href="https://ajayshahblog.blogspot.in/2015/02/become-public-policy-thinker-in-three.html">market
failure and an appropriate intervention</a> to address it, (b) conduct
a <a
 href="https://ajayshahblog.blogspot.in/2016/11/trumping-black-money.html">cost
benefit analyis</a> of the intervention, and (c) conduct an effective
<a
 href="https://ajayshahblog.blogspot.in/2016/01/participatory-governance-in-regulation.html">public
consultation</a> where the public knows about (a) and (b). Even after
the policy is enacted, the policy, by itself, is merely an
'output'. After allowing for a reasonable lag for transmission, the
State must identify whether the intended outcome of the policy has been
achieved. For example, the intended outcome of the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is to improve debt recovery rate in India. The
IBC was enacted in May 2016 and most of its provisions were notified
in November 2016. The IBC is an output. Allowing a medium term horizon
to allow the impact to play out, an impact assessment exercise will be
due in May 2020 to assess whether the recovery rates have improved
since the notification of the provisions of the IBC. The impact on
debt recovery rates would be the outcome. The effectiveness of IBC
must be measured with reference to this outcome.</p>

<p> In the field of capital controls in India, we find that State interventions
are almost never accompanied with the steps mentioned above (Burman
and Zaveri (2016)). An ex-post impact assessment of interventions in
this field, is unheard of. In this article, we conduct an ex-post impact assessment of
an intervention in the field of capital controls.</p> 

<h2> The intervention </h2>

<p> On 3rd February, 2015, RBI <a
				  href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9543&Mode=0">prohibited</a>
  FPIs from investing in (a) debt instruments with a
  maturity period of less than three years (such as
  corporate bonds with less than 3 years maturity and
  commercial papers), and (b) money market and liquid
  mutual fund schemes (as these schemes invested in
  corporate debt with less than 3 years maturity). In
  this article, for ease of reading, we call (a) the
  debt instruments with a maturity period of less than
  three years, "prohibited instruments"; and (b) the
  debt instruments with a maturity period of atleast
  three years, "eligible instruments". The restriction
  was effective from 4th February, 2015. However, FPIs
  were allowed to continue holding the prohibited
  instruments that they already held on 4th February,
  2015. Also, no lock in period was imposed on the
  eligible instruments acquired by FPIs, that is, FPIs
  could invest in and sell bonds with a maturity period
  of atleast three years, well before they matured.</p>


<p> The RBI circular did not specify what the market failure was or
  what the intervention was intended to achieve, except
  that the intervention was to bring consistency between
  the rules for FPI investment in corporate bonds at par
  with FPI investment in Government securities. It was
  not accompanied with a cost benefit analysis of the
  intervention, and it was not preceded by a public
  consultation process. We are not aware if RBI or the
  Central Government propose to undertake an ex-post
  impact assessment of this measure. In this article, we analyse what the
              intervention has achieved, more than a year after it was
  imposed.</p>

<h3> Questions: </h3>

<p> Due to the absence of a specific desired outcome in the RBI
  circular, we relied on <a
			    href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/rbi-wants-foreign-investors-to-shift-to-long-term-debt-115020301103_1.html">statements</a>
  made by RBI to the press. These statements as well as our
  conversations with RBI employees on public forums since the
  intervention, indicate that the intervention was intended to
  'nudge' FPI investment in long-term debt in India. Our analysis is,
  therefore, limited to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  
  <li><i>Question 1: Whether the regulatory intervention led to an increase in the
      FPI investment in long term corporate debt in India?</i></li>
  
  <li> <i> Question 2: Whether the regulatory intervention led to any
      change in the behaviour of foreign portfolio investors in relation
      to long term corporate debt in India? </i></li>
  
</ol>


<h3>A snapshot of the size of Indian corporate bond market</h3>

<p> Table 1 gives an overview of the size of the corporate debt
  market in India. Except for data on commercial paper (CP) issuances,
  data on the tenor of the debt instruments is not readily available
  in public domain. Hence, we use the size of the CP market as a proxy
  for the size of the short term debt market in India. The actual size
  of the short-term debt market would be larger. Table 1
  shows that that CP issuances alone account for atleast 30% of the
  overall debt market in India. </p>

  <h2> Description of data and methodology </h2>
    
<p> We use the daily holdings data from NSDL to identify the debt
instruments held by FPIs from January 2014 until March 2016. We then
identify the tenor of the debt instruments by using the issue and
expiry dates of each debt instrument held by each FPI during this
period.  With this data, we identify the change between (a) the
percentage of eligible instruments held by FPIs during 12 months
before the intervention; and (b) the percentage of eligible
instruments during 14 months after the intervention. We take a long
time-frame for the study. This helps filtering out the effect of other
macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy changes that could have
caused short term fluctuations in FPI participation in the Indian
corporate debt market.</p>

<h2> Analysis </h2>

<ol> <li> Question 1: After the intervention, we find that there is a
    marginal increase of 0.47% in the annual average FPI investment in
    eligible instruments.</p>

  <p> The percentage of eligible instruments held by FPIs during the
  study period is shown in Fig. 1. The vertical line on 3rd February,
  2015 is the date of the intervention. In the year immediately
  <i>preceding</i> the intervention, that is, from January
  2014-January 2015, FPIs, on an average, held 5.9% of the total
  eligible instruments issued by Indian issuers. For the period of one
  year after the ban, that is, from March 2015-April 2016, the
  corresponding average was 6.37%. Thus, there was a nominal increase
  of 0.47% in the holding of eligible instruments by FPIs after the
  intervention.</p> 

  <p> On 25th March, 2015, NTPC had issued eligible instruments to the
  tune of Rs. 10,306 crores, the largest ever issuance in terms of
  size by any private or public sector firm in India. We find that if
  we exclude the effect of the NTPC issuance, the nominal increase of
  0.47% also disappears and the average eligible instruments held by
  FPIs after the intervention would have fallen by 5.1%.</p>
  
<li> Question 2: We find that there is no change in the behaviour of
  FPIs in relation to their holding of eligible instruments,
  before and after the intervention. We observe that they continue
  to sell-off the eligible instruments held by them shortly after listing.</p>
  
  <p> From anecdotal conversations with market participants, we know
    that FPIs do not hold their local currency debt until maturity,
    especially where such debt is of a long-term nature. We notice this
    finding even in our data, as explained below.</p>
  
  <p> In November 2014, we see a steep incline in the percentage of
    eligible instruments held by FPIs in Fig.1. This is because of 85
    new issuances of long term debt instruments between 6th November
    and 12th November, in which FPIs participated vigorously. At this
    time, FPIs end up holding almost 26% of the outstanding eligible
    instruments. Thereafter, there is a steep fall almost immediately
    to 11%. Even after the intervention, we see a similar
    trend. Fig. 1 shows that for one month after the prohibition was
    imposed, the proportion of outstanding long term corporate bonds
    held by FPIs remains constant at about 11%. Thereafter, beginning
    sometime in March 2015 and continuing until the end of April 2015,
    the proportion of outstanding long term bonds held by FPIs drops
    from 11% to 6%. On 25th March, 2015, NTPC had issued long term
    debt instruments to the tune of Rs. 10,306 crores, the largest
    ever issuance in terms of size by any private or public sector
    firm. Hence, we see a small spike in the proportion of outstanding
    eligible instruments held by FPIs at that time. However,
    just like the November 2014 decline, the spike dissipates almost
    immediately.</p>
  
  <p> The steep decline after the spike in November 2014 and in March
    2015 may be due to two reasons: (a) FPIs may be redeeming bonds
    that have matured in November 2014 and March 2015 respectively;
    and/ or (b) FPIs may be selling bonds that they acquired in the
    spike immediately preceding the drop. To ascertain which of the
    two reasons led to the drop, we control for (a) the 85 issuances
    in November 2014; and (b) the NTPC issuance in March 2015, and
    re-plot the graph in Fig. 2. We observe that if we were to exclude
    the 85 issuances responsible for the spike in November 2014 and
    the NTPC issuance in March 2015, the proportion of FPI holdings of
    eligible instruments is nearly constant between 1% and 5%. In
    other words, there is no drop if there is no spike. This implies
    that the drop in November 2014 and March 2015 in Fig.1 can be
    attributed to the sale of long term corporate bonds by the
    FPIs.</p>

<p> Thus, using two instances - one before the intervention and
    another after the intervention - we show that the behaviour of
    FPIs has remained the same pre and post the intervention. FPIs
    continue to flip their long term holdings, selling them almost
    immediately within 1 month of having bought them, and hold only a
    minute proportion of the total long term corporate bonds
    issued.</p> </li>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p> An ex-post impact measurement exercise measures whether an
 intervention has achieved the intended outcome. It helps analyse
 whether any changes must be made to the intervention or the manner of
 its implementation to make it more effective. For example, if an
 ex-post impact assessment of the IBC in 2020 shows that there has
 been no improvement in the debt recovery rates in India, it should be
 a sufficient ground to re-visit the design of the law. It is to
 facilitate such an exercise that the Indian Financial Code drafted by
 the Justice Srikrishna-led Financial Sector Legislative Reforms
 Commission, requires every regulation to be reviwed three years after
 its enactment.</p>

<p> Our ex-post impact analysis of the intervention of restricting FPI
  investment in corporate debt with a maturity period of less than
  three years, finds no evidence of having achieved its intended
  outcome of channelising foreign capital from the short to long end
  of the corporate bond market. As shown above, neither do FPIs
  increase their participation in long term bond holdings as a result
  of the intervention nor do they alter their behaviour by holding the
  long term corporate debt securities until maturity.</p>

<p> We find that an attempt to centrally plan the allocation of
  foreign capital inflows, did not have the intended effect on atleast
  one occasion. On the other hand, the intervention withdrew foreign
  capital from the most liquid part of the Indian debt market. Pandey
  and Zaveri (2016) show that a substantial proportion of the bond
  issuances in similarly placed economies, such as Indonesia and South
  Korea, belong to the maturity bracket of one-three years. None of
  these economies prohibit foreign portfolio investment in local
  currency debt of this maturity bracket. In India too, before the
  intervention, there was significant FPI interest in the bond market
  with a maturity profile of less than three years. This is evident
  from the rapid utilisation of the debt limits for CPs. The reason
  for this is simple. It is easier to price currency and credit risk
  in debt of this maturity profile. For small to mid-sized Indian
  companies which are not known to foreign investors, it is easier to
  raise debt in this maturity profile from foreign
  investors. Globally, being able to raise foreign debt in local
  currency is a boon for debtors, as the currency risk is taken by the
  foreign investor. At a time when India is struggling to set up its
  corporate bond market, the intervention has resulted in depriving
  the relatively more liquid part of the market of significant
  participation.</p>
