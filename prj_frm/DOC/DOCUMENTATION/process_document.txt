In the current state, the application is divided into two primary
modules:-

Table generation module:

The module stored in the SRC section and is programmed in R. The
function of the module is to Read a JSON file in a pre-determined
format and calculate the score based on a pre-determined weighted
average format. The module also generates tables and graphs and
designates the files into the requisite folders for the generation of
the report.

Files:

read_data.R:- Reads the JSON file and decrypts the list to segregate
the headings and subheadings.
generate_reports.R:- Generates the tex tables to be used in the
report.
get_scores:- Calculates the weighted section scores based on the
weights alloted for each subsection in the section.
plot_measures.R:-
Plots the scores (daily timeseries) for each section calculated by the
get_scores.R function

Process:

In the current the module can handle automated generation for the
sections "legal foundations", "markets" and financial firms". The code
execution and the function calls are automated and the user needs to
only execute the Makefile for the tables and reports to be generated.
